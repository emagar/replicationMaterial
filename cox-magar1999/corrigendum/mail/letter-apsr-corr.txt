Dear Dr. Wood:

# I could find no means to send this message through the journal's web page. So I write directly.

An error is hidden in the text of our publication in the APSR (Cox and Magar 1999, vol. 93, issue 2, pp. 299-309).

The error involves our *interpretation* of the regression coefficient of a *control variable* in the model and therefore has minor impact. I nonetheless wish to inquire about the journal's policy regarding corrigenda.

(1) The coefficient reported in Table 1 is correct but, by failing to adopt the cross-temporal perspective, our interpretation of its effect on the regressand is incorrect.

(2) By not involving a regressor of theoretical interest, the error affects no substantive claim we make in the article.

Attached is a better description of this unfortunate yet inconsequential mistake. Please advise on how you would like us to proceed.

# (I have posted this as a corrigendum in a repository with code and data to replicate our analysis at https://github.com/emagar/replicationMaterial). 

Yours truly,

-Gary Cox and Eric Magar.
